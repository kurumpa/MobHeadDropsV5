# Mob Head Drops V5.1 Data Pack for Minecraft 1.16
Mob Head Drops V5.1 ("vanilla style") Data Pack allows mobs to drop their heads when killed by a charged creeper. Included are all mob heads added in Minecraft 1.15 and updated some of the old entities based on changes to the game (like Villagers and Zombie Villagers and Cats). This project is a fork of https://github.com/MadCatHoG/MobHeadDropsV5 with the addition of a few functions to remove all dropped heads but one, just like the original rules.

To enable the datapack, copy the zip file under the releases directory into your world's "datapacks" folder. If your server is running, make sure to run /reload.

## Known issues
- You can't obtain another charged creeper's head for some reason.
- Head removing function works in the radius of 20 blocks around the dead creeper, so multiple different explosions within that radius will interfere and result in fewer mob heads than expected.
- This functionality requires a creeper with a passenger, so any charged creeper will be immediately replaced with another one with the invisible passenger. But most certainly you won't notice it.
